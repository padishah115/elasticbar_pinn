# Physics-Informed Neural Network for Solving Elastic Bar DE

This repo is based on the work of [Kollmansberger et al.](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-76587-3), pages 60-63, where they attempt to solve the following equation: $$ \begin{equation} f:= \frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}x} \left(EA\frac{\text{d}u}{\text{d}x} \right) + p = 0 \end{equation}$$ subject to the Dirichlet boundary conditions $$\begin{equation}u(x=0) = u(x=1) = 0\end{equation}$$ where $u$ is displacement of the bar. We use a trial solution of the form $$\begin{equation}u(x) = \text{sin}(2 \pi x)\end{equation}$$ which implies an inhomogeneous term of the form $$p = 4\pi^2 \text{sin}(2 \pi x)$$ and a loss function $$\begin{align} J = \frac{1}{N_b} \sum_{i=1}^{N_b} \left| u_{NN}(x_b^i; \theta) - u(x_b^i)\right|^2 + \frac{1}{N_f} \sum_{i=1}^{N_f} \left| f(x_f^i) \right|^2 \end{align}$$ where the two terms encode the boundary conditions' residual and the PDE residual, respectively.
